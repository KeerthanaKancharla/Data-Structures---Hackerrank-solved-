# Data-Structures---Hackerrank-solved-
This repository consists of programs that I wrote to solve Data Structures on Hackerrank which is the first step in my journey of learning Data Structures. 
There might be similarities in the logics I used with programs written by other coders but I proclaim that the logics are written solely by me. 
I am Adding the hackerrank link in which I started practicing Data Structures to let you know where to find the questions for these codes.

Thankyou
